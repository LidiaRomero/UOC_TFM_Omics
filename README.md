# UOC_TFM: Developing tools for functional analysis of variants: from the variant list (VCF) to biological interpretation

To use the web application, it is necessary to download all the R files that form the app first.
R and RStudio must be installed.

Once downloaded, open the server file in the VCF VariantView folder with RStudio, at the top right of the code editor there is a button called "Run App".

The data used to develop the aplication have been obtained from: 
- Al Alawi I, Al Riyami M, Barroso-Hil M, Powell L, Olinger E, Al Salmi I, et al. The diagnostic yield of whole exome sequencing as a first approach in consanguineous Omani renal ciliopathy syndrome patients. F1000Res. 2021;10:207.
